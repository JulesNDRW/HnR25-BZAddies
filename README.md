# Hack & Roll 2025 Project - JellyVim Adventures
Our project aims to teach players how to use basic controls in Vim (similar to VimTutor) through a game. 

The game features a jellyfish who is trying to reach to the bottom of the sea without touching any turtles that may eat it! Along the way, the turtle may meet some fishes that will block their way down. We have used 'h','j','k', and 'l' for the left, down, up, right controls respectively. One may also press 'dd' to delete an entire row (using lasers) and to kill any turtles in that row.
